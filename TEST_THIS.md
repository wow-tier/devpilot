# 🧪 TEST THE FIX

## The Bug Was:
- Workspace tried to get repo from `localStorage.getItem('currentRepo')`
- But that key was **NEVER SET**
- So workspace always showed DevPilot files instead of YOUR GitHub repo

## The Fix:
- Workspace now calls `/api/repositories/:id` to fetch from PostgreSQL
- Gets YOUR GitHub URL from the database
- Clones YOUR actual GitHub repository
- Shows YOUR files in the editor

---

## 🚀 How to Test:

### 1. Start Dev Server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Open Browser Console:
- Go to: http://localhost:3000
- Press **F12** (Developer Tools)
- Go to **Console** tab

### 3. Login:
- Login or create account

### 4. Add YOUR GitHub Repository:
1. Click "Add Repository"
2. Enter YOUR repo:
   - Name: `my-test-repo`
   - URL: `https://github.com/your-username/your-repo`
   - Branch: `main`
3. Click "Add Repository"

### 5. Watch Console - Dashboard:
You should see:
```
🚀 Opening workspace for repository: my-test-repo
🔗 Repository ID: abc-123-xyz
🔗 Repository URL: https://github.com/your-username/your-repo
📂 Navigation URL: /workspace?repo=abc-123-xyz
```

### 6. Click "Open Workspace"

### 7. Watch Console - Workspace:
You should see:
```
📍 Workspace mounted
🔍 Repository ID from URL: abc-123-xyz
📡 Fetching repository details for ID: abc-123-xyz
✅ Repository fetched from database: { url: "https://github.com/your-username/your-repo", ... }
🔄 Starting clone for: https://github.com/your-username/your-repo
Starting repository clone for ID: abc-123-xyz
Sending clone request to API...
Clone API response: { success: true, path: "/workspace/user-repos/...", ... }
Repository cloned successfully to: /workspace/user-repos/your-user-id/my-test-repo
```

### 8. Check File Explorer:
- Should show **YOUR repository's files**
- NOT DevPilot's files (src/, package.json, etc.)
- Should show whatever is in YOUR GitHub repo

---

## ✅ Success Criteria:

1. **Console shows YOUR GitHub URL** ✅
2. **File explorer shows YOUR files** ✅
3. **Editor loads YOUR code** ✅
4. **NOT showing DevPilot workspace files** ✅

---

## ❌ If Still Broken:

Copy and paste ALL console output and tell me:
1. What repository URL you entered
2. What shows in the file explorer
3. Any error messages
