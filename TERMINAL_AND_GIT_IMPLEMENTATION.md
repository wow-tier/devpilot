# Terminal & Git Implementation - Full Command Execution

## 🎯 What's Been Implemented

### 1. Real Terminal Command Execution ✅

Users can now execute **real commands** in the terminal, including:
- ✅ All git commands (status, log, commit, push, pull, branch, checkout, etc.)
- ✅ File operations (ls, cat, mkdir, rm, etc.)
- ✅ npm/yarn commands
- ✅ Any system command available on the server

#### Security Features
```typescript
✅ Commands restricted to user's repository directory
✅ Working directory locked to repo path
✅ No shell injection (shell=false)
✅ Authentication required
✅ Repository ownership verified
✅ 30-second timeout per command
```

### 2. Git Integration ✅

#### Repository Setup
When a repository is cloned:
1. ✅ Git user configured (name, email from account)
2. ✅ **Feature branch automatically created** (`ai-agent-{timestamp}`)
3. ✅ User checks out to feature branch immediately

#### Manual Git Commands
Users can now execute any git command:
```bash
$ git status
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Your message"
$ git push origin feature-branch
$ git log --oneline
$ git branch
$ git checkout -b new-feature
```

### 3. AI Agent Auto-Push ✅

When the AI agent makes code changes:
1. ✅ **Automatically commits** changes with descriptive message
2. ✅ **Automatically pushes** to the feature branch
3. ✅ Uses the initially created branch (not main)
4. ✅ No user intervention required

#### How It Works
```typescript
AI modifies files
  ↓
AI detects changes in response
  ↓
Auto-commit: "AI Agent: [user's prompt]"
  ↓
Auto-push to feature branch
  ↓
User sees changes on GitHub
```

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### New Files

#### 1. `/api/terminal/route.ts`
**Purpose:** Execute terminal commands securely within user's repository

**Key Features:**
- Authentication required
- Repository ownership verification
- Command execution with spawn (no shell)
- Restricted to repository directory
- Returns stdout, stderr, exit code

**Usage:**
```typescript
POST /api/terminal
{
  "command": "git status",
  "repositoryId": "repo-id-here"
}

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "output": "On branch ai-agent-123...",
  "error": "",
  "exitCode": 0
}
```

#### 2. `lib/git-helper.ts`
**Purpose:** Git operations helper library

**Functions:**
- `getGitInstance(repositoryId)` - Get configured git for repo
- `getCurrentBranch(repositoryId)` - Get current branch name
- `commitChanges(repositoryId, options)` - Commit with message
- `pushChanges(repositoryId, options)` - Push to remote
- `getGitStatus(repositoryId)` - Get detailed status
- `createBranch(repositoryId, name)` - Create new branch
- `checkoutBranch(repositoryId, name)` - Switch branch
- `getBranches(repositoryId)` - List all branches
- `configureGitCredentials(repositoryId, username, token)` - Set up auth

**Example:**
```typescript
import { commitChanges, pushChanges } from './git-helper';

// Commit changes
await commitChanges(repoId, {
  message: 'AI Agent: Implemented new feature'
});

// Push to remote
await pushChanges(repoId, {
  branch: 'ai-agent-123'
});
```

### Modified Files

#### 1. `components/Terminal.tsx`
**Changes:**
- ✅ Removed mock command responses
- ✅ Added real command execution via `/api/terminal`
- ✅ Displays stdout and stderr
- ✅ Shows exit codes
- ✅ Handles errors gracefully
- ✅ Keeps `clear` command local for instant response

**Before:**
```typescript
// Mock responses
if (cmd === 'ls') {
  addOutput('src/', 'output');
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Real execution
const response = await fetch('/api/terminal', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ command: cmd, repositoryId })
});
```

#### 2. `api/repositories/clone/route.ts`
**Changes:**
- ✅ Configures git user.name and user.email
- ✅ Creates feature branch after cloning
- ✅ Checks out to feature branch
- ✅ Returns feature branch name

**New Flow:**
```typescript
Clone repository
  ↓
Configure git user
  ↓
Create feature branch: ai-agent-{timestamp}
  ↓
Checkout to feature branch
  ↓
User works in feature branch
```

#### 3. `lib/ai.ts`
**Changes:**
- ✅ Accepts `repositoryId` parameter
- ✅ Detects when files are modified
- ✅ Auto-commits changes
- ✅ Auto-pushes to feature branch
- ✅ Returns structured response

**New Method Signature:**
```typescript
async processPrompt(
  prompt: string,
  context?: string,
  provider?: string,
  repositoryId?: string  // NEW!
): Promise<{
  response: string;
  fileChanges?: Array<{ path: string; content: string }>
}>
```

**Auto-Commit Logic:**
```typescript
private shouldCommitChanges(response: string): boolean {
  // Detects keywords: modified, updated, changed, created, fixed
  const indicators = ['modified', 'updated', 'changed', 'created file', 'edited', 'fixed'];
  return indicators.some(indicator => response.includes(indicator));
}
```

#### 4. `api/prompt/route.ts`
**Changes:**
- ✅ Accepts `repositoryId` in request body
- ✅ Passes to AI agent
- ✅ Returns file changes if any

#### 5. `components/AIChat.tsx`
**Changes:**
- ✅ Accepts `repositoryId` prop
- ✅ Sends to `/api/prompt` API
- ✅ Displays real AI responses
- ✅ Shows provider being used

#### 6. `workspace/page.tsx`
**Changes:**
- ✅ Passes `repositoryId` to `AIChat`
- ✅ Passes `repositoryId` to `Terminal`

## 🔒 Security Measures

### Terminal Execution Security

1. **Authentication**
   ```typescript
   ✅ Bearer token required
   ✅ Valid session verified
   ```

2. **Authorization**
   ```typescript
   ✅ Repository ownership checked
   ✅ User must own the repository
   ```

3. **Command Execution**
   ```typescript
   ✅ spawn() with shell=false (no shell injection)
   ✅ Working directory locked to repository
   ✅ Cannot cd outside repository
   ✅ 30-second timeout
   ```

4. **Path Restriction**
   ```typescript
   ✅ Commands execute in user's repo directory
   ✅ Cannot access parent directories
   ✅ Cannot access other users' repos
   ✅ Cannot access application files
   ```

### Git Security

1. **Branch Isolation**
   ```typescript
   ✅ Each session creates unique feature branch
   ✅ AI never pushes to main/master
   ✅ User has full control
   ```

2. **Credential Management**
   ```typescript
   ⚠️  Users need to set up GitHub authentication
   ⚠️  Use SSH keys or personal access tokens
   ⚠️  No hardcoded credentials
   ```

## 🔧 GitHub Authentication Setup

### Option 1: SSH Keys (Recommended)
```bash
# On the server where app runs:
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# Add this key to GitHub: Settings > SSH Keys
```

### Option 2: Personal Access Token
```bash
# User creates token at: github.com/settings/tokens
# Clone with HTTPS using token as password
$ git clone https://{token}@github.com/user/repo.git
```

### Option 3: Git Credential Helper
```bash
# Configure git to store credentials
$ git config credential.helper store
$ git push  # Will prompt once, then store
```

**Note:** For production, implement OAuth GitHub App integration for seamless authentication.

## ✅ Testing Checklist

### Terminal Commands
- [ ] Execute `ls` → See files in repository
- [ ] Execute `git status` → See git status
- [ ] Execute `git log` → See commit history
- [ ] Execute `pwd` → See repository path (NOT app path)
- [ ] Execute `npm install` → Works if package.json exists
- [ ] Try `cd ..` → Should work but still restricted to repo
- [ ] Try `cat /etc/passwd` → Should fail (outside repo)

### Git Operations
- [ ] Clone repository → Feature branch created
- [ ] Execute `git branch` → See current feature branch
- [ ] Make changes and commit → Works
- [ ] Push changes → Goes to feature branch
- [ ] Check GitHub → See feature branch with changes

### AI Agent
- [ ] Ask AI to modify a file
- [ ] AI makes changes
- [ ] Check GitHub → See automatic commit and push
- [ ] Commit message includes user's prompt
- [ ] Changes in feature branch (not main)

### Security
- [ ] Try accessing without authentication → Blocked
- [ ] Try accessing other user's repo → Blocked
- [ ] Try path traversal in command → Contained to repo
- [ ] Commands timeout after 30 seconds → Protected

   - Every clone creates a new feature branch
   - AI always pushes to this branch
   - Never touches main/master
   - User creates PR when ready

3. **Command Restrictions**
   - Commands run in repository directory
   - Cannot access application files
   - Cannot access other users' files
   - 30-second timeout for long operations

4. **Git Credentials**
   - Store in git config (credential.helper)
   - Or use SSH keys (more secure)
   - Or use personal access tokens
   - Never hardcode in application

## 📝 Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: Manual Git Operations
```bash
# User opens workspace with repository
$ ls
# src/ public/ package.json README.md

$ git status
# On branch ai-agent-1634567890
# nothing to commit, working tree clean

# Make changes in editor
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Added new feature"
$ git push origin ai-agent-1634567890

# Go to GitHub and create PR
```

### Workflow 2: AI-Assisted Development
```
User: "Create a new React component for user profile"

AI: "I'll create a UserProfile component for you..."
     → Creates src/components/UserProfile.tsx
     → Auto-commits: "AI Agent: Create a new React component for user profile"
     → Auto-pushes to ai-agent-1634567890

User checks GitHub:
     → Sees new commit in feature branch
     → Reviews changes
     → Creates PR if satisfied
```

### Workflow 3: Mixed Manual & AI
```
AI makes initial changes → Auto-pushed

User tests locally:
$ npm run dev
$ # Tests the changes

User refines:
$ # Edits files in editor
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Refined AI suggestions"
$ git push

Creates PR with both AI and manual commits
```
