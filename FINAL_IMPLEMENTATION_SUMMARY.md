- ✅ **Authentication required** (token validation)

- ✅ **Ownership verification** before any operation
- ✅ **Path traversal protection** (blocks `../`, absolute paths)
- ✅ All operations scoped to user's repo only

#### Workspace Security
- ✅ **Requires valid repository parameter**
- ✅ Shows error if no repo selected
- ✅ Validates user owns the repository
- ✅ Terminal restricted to repo directory
- ✅ No access to application source code

#### What's Blocked
```bash
❌ /workspace → Now requires ?repo=xxx
❌ /api/files without repositoryId
❌ Path traversal attempts (../)
❌ Accessing other users' repositories
❌ Accessing application files
❌ Unauthorized file operations
```

---

### 💾 4. Settings Persistence (100% Working!)

```

✅ POST    /api/user/avatar       - Upload profile photo
✅ GET/PUT /api/user/preferences  - Save ALL preferences
```

#### What Saves
- ✅ Display name
- ✅ GitHub username
- ✅ Profile photo (max 2MB, validates type)
- ✅ Email notifications (4 toggles)
- ✅ AI model, temperature, max tokens
- ✅ Editor theme, font size
- ✅ High contrast, reduce animations

#### Storage Locations
- Profile data → `User` table
- Photo → `public/uploads/avatars/`
- Preferences → `ActivityLog` table (JSON)

---

### 🌐 5. Authenticated Navigation (100% Complete!)

- ✅ Created `AuthNavigation` component

```

```

#### Where Applied
